**Ans.1 c) How do you approach the development problem?** 
Approaching any developement problem is all about, learning the root cause of the problem and take care of it. There are various steps to resolve the problem, some of which I have mentioned here.
Understand the Requirements: The first step is to gather clear and detailed requirements from stakeholders or clients. This involves understanding the problem domain, the target audience, desired features, and any constraints or limitations.

Define Scope and Objectives: Based on the gathered requirements, developers define the scope of the project and set specific objectives to achieve within the given constraints.

Design the Architecture: Developers create a high-level system architecture that outlines the components, data flow, and interactions required to implement the application. This phase helps in planning the project's structure and scalability.

Choose Technologies: Based on the project's requirements and objectives, developers choose the appropriate technologies and tools for the development stack. This includes programming languages, frameworks, databases, and any third-party libraries or APIs.

Break Down into Tasks: The development problem is broken down into smaller tasks or user stories. Each task represents a specific feature or functionality that needs to be implemented.

Implement the Solution: Developers start coding and implementing the solution, following best practices, coding standards, and design patterns. They focus on creating clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.

Test and Debug: Throughout the development process, developers perform testing at various levels to ensure the application functions correctly. Bugs and issues are identified and fixed during this phase.

Iterate and Improve: Development is an iterative process, and developers often get feedback from stakeholders or users to make improvements and refine the application.

Conduct Quality Assurance: Dedicated quality assurance (QA) teams or developers perform thorough testing to ensure the application meets the specified requirements and functions as expected.

Deploy and Monitor: Once the application is ready, it is deployed to the target environment. Developers may also implement monitoring tools to track the application's performance and identify potential issues.

Provide Support and Maintenance: After deployment, developers may need to provide ongoing support, maintenance, and updates to keep the application running smoothly and address any issues that may arise.

Seek User Feedback: Developers continuously seek user feedback to understand how well the application meets users' needs and make further improvements based on that feedback.

Throughout the development process, collaboration, communication, and teamwork are crucial for successfully solving the development problem and delivering a high-quality application.


**Ans 1.d) What were interesting aspects where you copied code from Stack Overflow?**
Stack Overflow is a valuable resource for programmers and developers, especially when we encounter challenges or errors in our code. Here's how Stack Overflow can be helped me in resolving my coding problems:

Error Identification: When we encounter an error or unexpected behavior in our code, it can be challenging to identify the root cause on our own, especially if we are not familiar with the particular error message. Stack Overflow is often an excellent place to search for the specific error message I encountered. Many developers have faced similar issues in the past and have posted questions about them on Stack Overflow. By searching for the error message, I was able to find threads where others have encountered the same issue, and solutions have been provided.

Diverse Knowledgebase: Stack Overflow has a vast and diverse community of developers from various backgrounds and expertise. As a result, the chances are high that someone else has faced and resolved a similar problem before. This diversity in the user base contributes to a wide range of questions and solutions covering multiple programming languages, frameworks, and technologies.

Detailed Explanations: Stack Overflow answers often provide detailed explanations of the problem and the solution. This is especially helpful for learners or developers who want to understand not just the fix but also the underlying cause and reasoning behind it.
